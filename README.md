# MancHACK2017
This is the work from the Manchester Hackathon 2017.

###### - How To Use -
 You'll need to allow the program access to your devices camera, and also scan an item with a barcode; the rest was designed to be easy to follow.
 
###### - About -
 The program was designed to provide a solution to Dunnhumbys challenge (explained below).
 The idea of this program was to allow customers to scan a barcode of any shops item, which will then be stored on the system, and then buy all  the items at once. This allows a quick and efficient shop for all users, allowing them to go into the shop, scan their items on the go and then purchase the items without having to stop or cause a queue within the shop.
 
###### - The Challenge -
> "We challenge you to use technology to enhance the retail experience for a customer in the home or in store.
This could be anything from mapping the most efficient way around a supermarket given a customer's shopping list, to a home automation app that creates an alert if you've run out of orange squash based on your previous shopping habits.
